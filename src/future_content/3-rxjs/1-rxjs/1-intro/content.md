# RxJS

## RxJS Tutorial Outline

### Introduction to RxJS

- What is RxJS?
- Core concepts: Observables, Subjects, Operators
- Benefits of using RxJS in Angular applications

### Creating and Subscribing to Observables

- Creating Observables: `of`, `from`, `interval`, `timer`
- Subscribing to Observables: `subscribe` method
- Understanding the `next`, `error`, and `complete` callbacks

### Essential RxJS Operators

- **Transformation Operators:**
  - `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `concatMap`, `switchMap`, `mergeMap`, `exhaustMap`
- **Creation Operators:**
  - `of`, `from`, `interval`, `timer`, `defer`
- **Combination Operators:**
  - `combineLatest`, `forkJoin`, `zip`
- **Utility Operators:**
  - `shareReplay`, `distinctUntilKeyChanged`, `debounceTime`

### Working with Subjects

- `BehaviorSubject`, `ReplaySubject`, `AsyncSubject`
- Using Subjects for state management and communication

### Error Handling in RxJS

- `catchError` operator
- Custom error handling strategies
- Retrying failed operations

### Advanced RxJS Topics

- Hot and cold observables
- Backpressure
- Custom operators
- RxJS patterns and best practices

### Integrating RxJS with Angular

- Using RxJS with Angular's `async` pipe
- RxJS-based state management solutions (e.g., NgRx)
- RxJS for handling HTTP requests and events

### Practical Examples

- Building a reactive form
- Implementing a debounce search feature
- Creating a custom RxJS operator

### Conclusion

- Recap of key concepts and benefits of RxJS
- Encouraging further exploration and practice
